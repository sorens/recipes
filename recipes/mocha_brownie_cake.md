## Ingredients

### Ganache

    * 1 1/4 cups heavy cream
    * 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
    * 3 tablespoons sugar
    * 12 ounces semisweet chocolate, coarsely chopped
    * 1/4 cup hot strong brewed coffee

### Cake

    * 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
    * 3/4 teaspoon baking powder
    * 1/4 teaspoon salt
    * 4 1/2 ounces semisweet chocolate, coarsely chopped
    * 2 1/2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, coarsely chopped
    * 3/4 stick (3 ounces) unsalted butter
    * 5 large eggs
    * 1 cup sugar
    * 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
    * 3 tablespoons sour cream


## Instructions

Heat the heavy cream, butter, and sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture reaches the boil. Put the chopped chocolate in a large bowl and pour in the boiling cream and the hot coffee. Set the mixture aside for 5 minutes, then stir until smooth. The ganache must cool thoroughly. You can leave it to cool at room temperature --which could take an hour or so --or you can refrigerate it. The ganache thickens as it cools. You want to use it when it just begins to thicken and can be poured rather than spread over the cake.

Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Butter a 9-inch round cake pan and dust with flour, tapping out the excess; set aside. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl and reserve. Heat an inch of water in the bottom of a double boiler. Put the semisweet and unsweetened chocolates and the butter in the top of the double boiler, and heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is fully blended and smooth. Remove the pan from the heat. Put the eggs, sugar, and vanilla in the bowl of a mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, or use a hand mixer, and whip on high speed for 4 to 5 minutes, or until the eggs are slightly thickened and doubled in volume. Add the melted chocolate and mix at medium speed for 15 seconds. Don't worry if the chocolate is not fully incorporated --it will blend in as you add the other ingredients. Remove the bowl from the mixer and, working with a rubber spatula, gently but thoroughly fold in the dry ingredients. Give the sour cream a vigorous turn or two with a whisk to loosen it, and fold it into the batter. The batter will be quite think.

Pour the batter into the pan and, with a spatula, smooth and level the batter. Bake the cake for 45 to 50 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Transfer the ake to a cooling rack and let cool in the pan for 20 minutes. Turn the cake out onto a cardboard cake round (or the round from a tart pan with a removable bottom) and refrigerate, uncovered, for 1 hour.
