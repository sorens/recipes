## Summary

By the time I was old enough to ask for the recipe, my Grandmother had simplified the recipe to "buying frozen bread dough, then frying it." In an attempt to recpature the recipe, I have used a few different white bread recipes. I'll eventually publish one here.

## Ingredients

    * frozen bread dough (eventually replace with real dough recipe)
    * 1 Cup red wine
    * 3-4 Tbsp honey

## Instructions

Defrost bread dough and let it rise. Cut off small pieces, roll in your hand and then deep fry in hot oil for a minute per side. Remove from hot oil and place on paper towel to cool and soak up excess oil. Once all dough has been fried, heat wine in a sauce pot. Add honey and stir. Let simmer for a few minutes. Remove from heat. Drop in fried balls of bread to soak up wine and honey mixture. Remove from sauce and repeat with remaining zeppole.
