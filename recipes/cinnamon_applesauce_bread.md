## Ingredients

    * 2 t. yeast
    * 2 C white flour
    * 1 C. whole wheat flour
    * 1 C. oatmeal (fine)
    * 1/2 C. applesauce
    * 2 t. cinnamon
    * 3 T. brown sugar
    * 1 egg
    * 2 T. butter/margerine
    * 1/2 t. salt
    * 1 C. water
    * 1/2 - 1 C. raisins (added at the beeps to keep them whole)

## Instructions

Add yeast first. Add remaining ingredients and finally the water. Bake on Medium. Oatmeal is optional. More raisins are good. Can try leaving out cinnamon from first kneading cycle, and then adding a cinnamon/brown sugar mixture 1 minute or so before kneading cycle ends. Makes cinnamon marbled throughout the bread (hard to get right, though).

I believe this uses a bread machine...
