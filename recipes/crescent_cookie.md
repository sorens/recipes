## Ingredients

    * 1 cup of walnuts, chopped finely
    * 1 cup of butter
    * 3/4 cup sugar
    * 2 1/2 cups Flour
    * powdered sugar

## Instructions

Combine flour and chopped walnuts, mix well and set aside. Whip butter and sugar until fluffy. Add flour and walnut mixture to the creamed butter. Form into a ball. Keep chilled. Using your hands, roll small portions into a cylinder. Place on cookie sheet, bend the ends to form a crescent. Then press gently with palm of the hand or the bottom of a buttered glass to flatten the shape somewhat.

Bake in top third of the oven at 350Â°F for 15 minutes.
