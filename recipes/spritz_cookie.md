# Spritz Cookie (Press Cookie)

## Summary

Truthfully, I no longer make these cookies. I have broken too many cookie presses. They are all made of plastic now and the mechanism just can't handle the pressure required to press a good cookie dough. My mother's generation had a metal cookie press. If I find one at a yard sale, I might make these again...

## Ingredients

    * 1 C unsalted butter, softened
    * 3/4 C sugar
    * 2 large egg yolks
    * 1/4 teaspoon salt
    * 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
    * 3/4 teaspoon almond extract (optional)
    * 2 1/4 all-purpose flour

## Instructions

Using an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar until very fluffy and well blended. Add the following items and beat until evenly incorporated: 

    * 2 large egg yolks
    * salt
    * vanilla
    * almond extract 

Sift flour over butter mixture. Stir flour into batter until well blended. Press cookies. If it seems soft and difficult to handle, stir in 1 to 2 tablespoons of flour to firm it up. Cover and refrigerate batter for 30 to 40 minutes or until slightly stiff but *not at all hard*. 

Push out cookies one inch apart. Refrigerate unused dough as you work. Preheat oven to 350Â°F atleast 30 minutes before baking. Slightly grease cookie sheets. Bake one sheet at a time in the upper third of the oven for 9 to 12 minutes or until the cookies are slightly golden or just barely brown at the edges. Transfer sheets to wire racks and let stand for cookies to firm up. Transfer cookies to wire rack to firm up completely. Store air-tight for 10 days or freeze up to 1 month.
