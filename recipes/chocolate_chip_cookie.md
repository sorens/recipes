## Ingredients

### Dry Ingredients

    * 2 1/4 cups all purpose flour
    * 1 teaspoon salt
    * 1 teaspoon baking soda

### Wet Ingredients

    * 3/4 cup brown sugar, firmly packed
    * 3/4 cup granulated sugar
    * 1 cup of butter (unsalted, softendedx)
    * 1/2 teaspoon double strength vanilla extract
    * 1 teaspoon almond extract (optional)
    * 2 eggs, room temperature

### Chocolate

    * 1 package of Trader Joe's semi-sweet chocolate chips (12 oz)

## Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.

1. Sift flour into a bowl and combine with salt and baking soda. Set aside.
2. Cream butter with sugar, brown sugar and vanilla. Butter and sugar should well creamed and homogenous. Batter should be very sweet.
3. Add, one a time, eggs. Beat on medium until egg is completely incorporated into batter
4. Combine the combined dry materials 1/2 cup at a time. Make sure the dry ingredients are well incorporated into the batter before adding more dry ingredients.
5. Add chocolate chips. If you are using a mixer, use a lower setting so as not to "bruise" chocolate chips.
6. Drop tablespoon size portion of batter onto cookie sheet, evenly spaced, 12 to a sheet. 
7. Bake in upper third of the oven for 7-10 minutes. Becareful not to burn! Transfer right away to wire rack to cool.

## Notes

* I use unsalted butter. When I was growing up, my mother used salted butter. I prefer the taste of unsalted butter and control the saltiness of the cookies by adding or removing salt.
* The batter is much easier to work with and makes a better looking cookie if the butter is soft but not liquid. Ingredients at room temperature make a difference!
* I sift the flour and then add it to the wet ingredients in smaller batches to keep some of the air to create a "puffier" cookie. It doesn't always work.
