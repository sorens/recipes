## Ingredients

    * 12 ounces mascarpone cheese
    * 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon Ghirardelli Sweet Ground Chocolate and Cocoa
    * 1/3 cup confectioners' sugar
    * 1/2 cup coffee-flavored liqueur
    * 1-1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
    * 1/2 teaspoon salt (optional)
    * 1-1/2 cups heavy whipping cream
    * 2 tablespoons water
    * 2 teaspoons powdered instant espresso coffee
    * 6 ounces ladyfingers (about 2 dozen), halved

## Instructions

Yields 15 servings In a large mixing bowl, heat the mascarpone, 6 tablespoons of the ground chocolate, 1/4 cup of the confectioners' sugar, 1/4 cup of the liqueur, 1 teaspoon of the vanilla extract, and the salt with a wire whisk. Set aside. In a small bowl beat 1 cup of the whipping cream until stiff peaks form. Fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture. In another small bowl, combine the remaining 1/4 cup liqueur, the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract, the water, and the espresso powder. Line a 2-1/2 quart glass or crystal bowl with one fourth of the ladyfingers; brush with 2 tablespoons of the espresso mixture. Spoon one third of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers. Repeat, making 2 more layers of ladyfingers brushed with the espresso mixture and topped with the mascarpone mixture. Top with the remaining ladyfingers, gently pressing them into the cheese mixture. Brush the ladyfingers with the remaining espresso mixture. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of ground chocolate over the top. In a small mixing bowl, beat the remaining 1/2 cup whipping cream and the remaining confectioners' sugar until stiff peaks form. Spoon the whipped cream into a decorating bag with a large star-shaped tip. Pipe large rosettes on top of the dessert. Sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons of ground chocolate on the rosettes. Chill at least 2 hours. Note: If you cannot find mascarpone cheese, substitute 16 ounces of softened cream cheese and 3 tablespoons of milk. Beat on medium until smooth and fluffy. Add 6 tablespoons of the ground chocolate, 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar, 3 tablespoons coffee-flavored liqueur, 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, and omit the salt; set aside. Continue as the recipe directs.
