## Ingredients

    * 4 stalks of celery, chopped
    * 4-10 cloves of garlic, minced
    * 1 can of black olives, drained
    * 1 can of green olives, drained (pimentos optional)
    * 1 jar of marinated artichoke hearts
    * 14 oz white, raw mushrooms, stems/pieces
    * olive oil (up to 1 cup)
    * red wine vinegar (up to 3-4 tablespoons)
    * oregano, dried, crushed (2-4 tablespoons)
    * packaged pepporoni, sliced thin (optional)
    * provolone cheese, sliced (or asiago chunked)
    * crackers

## Instructions

Drain olives, set aside. Drain artichoke hearts, retain liquid. Chop artichoke hearts. Chop mushrooms. Mince garlic. Chop celery.

Combine olives, artichoke hearts, mushrooms, garlic, celery, oregano.

Add a liberal amount of olive oil but only a few tablespoons of red wine vinegar. 

Stir thoroughly so that all ingredients are mixed and coated with olive oil, vinegar and oregano. Optional: combine asiago, provolone or other suitable hard cheese.

Refrigerate.

Remove from refrigeration and mix again one hour prior to serving.

Mom's original recipe did not include the cheese in the ante pasta, instead the pepperoni, cheese and crackers were served along side. However, over the years, I have adapted it to remove the pepperoni altogether, switch to a hard asiago cheese, which is diced and combined with the other ingredients in a later step. Still serve with crackers, small bowls and small spoons.
