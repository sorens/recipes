Add potatoes and cook until they aere just barely done. Pour into a strainer and rinse quickly with cool water. Place potatoes on a towel to dry. Heat Trader Joes's Clarified Butter and olive oil in a large, wide skillet on high. Lower heat to medium and add the potatoes. Let them sit for several minutes until they begin to form a crust on the bottom, turn potatoes to brown on all sides. Add onion to potatoes to soften. When potatoes are nicely browned, add the tomatoes, basil and pepper. Remove from heat. Quickly toss the cubes of cheese among the potatoes and serve.
