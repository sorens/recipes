## Ingredients

    * stick unsalted butter (let soften in pieces at room temperature)
    * 1 t vanilla extract
    * 1 C brown sugar
    * 2 eggs
    * 1/2 cup melted chocolate (ghiradelli bars or other chocolate chips)
    * 3 sheets plastic wrap
    * powdered sugar

### Dry Ingredients
    * 1 C Flour 
    * 1/2 C Cocoa powder 
    * 2 t baking powder 
    * 1/8 t salt

## Instructions

Mix dry ingredients well and set aside.

In another bowl: 1 stick unsalted butter (let soften in pieces at room temperature) 1 t vanilla extract 1 C brown sugar Beat butter, vanilla & sugar. Mix until creamy. Add 2 eggs and keep beating. Add 1/2 cup melted chocolate to the mix. Beat into the mixture. Then with wooden spoon, gently stir in dry ingredients. It should be soft -- like a brownie mix.

Set out 3 sheets of plastic wrap. Put 1/3 of mix onto one end of each sheet. Then wrap each sheet into a cylinder and place into the refridgerator for 45-60 minutes. They should be hard. When you remove them from the fridge, unroll gently and dust them all over with powdered sugar -- and then roll them back up again (in the same sheets of plastic wrap) for at least another 30-45 minutes in the fridge. Preheat oven to 350. Remove from the fridge and unwrap rolls. Cut them (one at a time) into 1/2" rings and roll each ring by hand, (dip into powdered sugar so they wonâ€™t stick) press just a little and then place them on baking sheet.

Bake at 350 for 10-12 minutes. They should be soft. Let them cool and enjoy!
