    * 1/3 cup softened butter

    * 2 eggs
    * 4 ripe bananas
    * 2-3 cups flour

    * 1 teaspoon salt
    * 1 cup walnuts (optional)

## Instructions

Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Lightly coat the insides of a round bunt pan with oil to prevent sticking. In a mixer, cream sugar, butter and vanilla extract together. Add eggs and continue mixing until they are well incorporated. Add bananas and mix until there are no lumps. Mix in flour 1/2 cup at a time. (If you want more of a sticky bread, use less flour.) Mix in the baking soda, baking powder and salt. Fold in walnuts if desired. Pour mixture into the bunt pan. Bake for 40-50 minutes, until top of bread is brown. Remove from oven and let cool for 10-15 minutes. Invert pan to remove the bread.
