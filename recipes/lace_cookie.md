This recipe originated with my Grandmother. It has been heavily modified over the years myself. This is my favorite cookie. My grandmother would make be a batch or two every Christmas holiday. Over the years, I have experimented and modified the recipe to suit my tastes.

## Ingredients

    1/2 C butter
    1/2 C light corn syrup
    2/3 C firmly packed brown sugar
    1 C all-puprose sifted flour
    1 C finely chopped nuts
    1 C semisweet chocolate pieces

## Instructions

Combine flour and chopped nuts, mix and set aside.

Place butter, light corn syrup and sugar in the top part of double boiler. Bring mixture to a boil while mixing as it melts. Once combined, remove from heat immediately. Blend in flour mixture. 

Drop by rounded 1/2 teaspoons 3 inches apart onto a Silpat™ (or similar) baking sheet. Ensure adequate separation of dough, as the cookies will spread as the bake. Bake in preheated slow oven 325°F for 7 to 10 minutes.

Keep remaining batter warm over hot water between batches. 

Cool for 30 secs to 1 minute before removing from sheet. Note: timing here is dependent on actual heat of oven. If your oven is hotter than average, the cookies can cook in less than 7 minutes. It is also dependent on how "well-done" you like to cookies. Cool cookies on wired cooling racks.

Place chocolate over hot water and stir. When partially metled, remove from hot water, stir until melted. Then brush on each cooled cookie. (Too high temperature of chocolate makes drying slow.) 

Makes about 6 dozen

In the past, we used greased coookie sheets (it is best to grease with both butter and/or non-stick butter spray. you can also use non-stick spray on spoon to make it easier on placing dough on sheet). However, SilPat™ and other silicone based baking sheets have made producing these cookies much simpler and less error prone.
