# Grandma's Chicken Soup

## Summary

This is one of the first recipes I learned to make. The only recipe I've used more often than this chicken soup recipe is our chocolate chip cookie recipe. The original recipe that Grandma and Mom used called for using a boullion cube to augment the flavor. Instead of a boullion cube, I would boil down the remaining bones into a chicken stock, freeze that and use that for the next chicken soup.

## Ingredients

    * 5-6 lb whole chicken, fresh
    * 5-7 carrots, large, chopped
    * 5-7 celery stalks, large, chopped
    * 2 onions, coursely chopped
    * a boullion cube of chicken (or chicken stock)
    * dill, fresh, finely chopped
    * 1 bay leaf

## Instructions

Make sure to remove the giblets from the chicken. Place the whole chicken in large stock pot. Cover chicken with water, cover with lid and bring to a boil. Simmer for 45-60 minutes. Add celery, carrots, onions and boullion (or chicken stock). Add dill, salt and pepper to taste (my preference is for extensive ammounts of dill). Add a bay leaf. Cook for another 45-60 minutes. Remove from heat. Remove chicken from pot. Remove meat from bones. Return meat to the broth and serve over rice or noodles. Use remaining bones/parts to produce chicken stock if so desired.
